First make sure you have installed these prerequisites. Things will not work without them!

Visual Studio 2015 Update 3. Note that Update 2 is not enough. You need Update 3, because it fixes some issues with NPM, plus it’s a prerequisite for TypeScript 2.0.
.NET Core 1.0.1
TypeScript 2.0 for Visual Studio 2015. If Visual Studio keeps complaining Cannot find name 'require', it’s because you forgot to install this.
Node.js version 4 or later. We temporarily don’t support Node 0.x because of this issue, but might re-add support for Node 0.x in the future. To check your Node version, run node -v in a command prompt.
Now you’ve checked the prerequisites are installed, just download and install the ASP.NET Core Template Pack extension.
